# Project Overview: Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Analysis

## Introduction
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique that allows for the examination of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and function that bulk RNA sequencing cannot. The project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive workflow for scRNA-seq data analysis, covering from data preprocessing and quality control to clustering and identifying cell types.

## Goals
1. **Understanding Cellular Heterogeneity**: To identify and characterize different cell types within a heterogeneous population.
2. **Quality Control**: To ensure that the data used for downstream analysis is of high quality, removing low-quality cells and potential artifacts.
3. **Normalization and Integration**: To normalize the data to correct for technical variations and integrate multiple datasets to handle batch effects.
4. **Clustering and Visualization**: To cluster cells into distinct groups based on their gene expression profiles and visualize these clusters.
5. **Marker Gene Identification**: To identify marker genes for each cluster, which helps in annotating cell types and understanding their biological functions.

##  Pre-processing and Quality Control

### Quality Control Set-Up
- **Objective**: Establish an organized environment for data analysis.
- **Actions**: 
  - Download and prepare sample data for analysis.
  - Load essential R libraries for scRNA-seq analysis.
  - Load raw count matrices into a Seurat object for further analysis.
- **Outcome**: Prepared workspace and data for quality control steps.

### Quality Control
- **Objective**: Filter out low-quality cells and ensure data integrity.
- **Actions**: 
  - Perform initial filtering based on the number of UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifiers).
  - Calculate QC metrics such as cell counts, UMIs per cell, genes detected per cell, and mitochondrial gene expression.
  - Visualize these metrics to identify and remove low-quality cells.
- **Outcome**: A high-quality dataset ready for downstream analysis.

###  PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Objective**: PCA use in dimensionality reduction.
- **Actions**: 
  - Show how PCA helps in reducing the dimensionality of scRNA-seq data while retaining important variability.
- **Outcome**: PCA  application in scRNA-seq data analysis.

### Normalization and Regressing Out Unwanted Variation
- **Objective**: Normalize the data to reduce technical variability.
- **Actions**: 
  - Normalize the data using appropriate methods.
  - Regress out unwanted sources of variation (e.g., batch effects).
- **Outcome**: A normalized dataset with reduced technical noise, suitable for accurate analysis.

## Advanced Analysis

### Integration
- **Objective**: Integrate multiple scRNA-seq datasets to handle batch effects.
- **Actions**: 
  - Use integration techniques to combine datasets from different batches or conditions.
  - Ensure that biological signals are preserved while technical artifacts are minimized.
- **Outcome**: A cohesive dataset that accurately reflects biological variability without batch effects.

### Clustering
- **Objective**: Group cells into distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles.
- **Actions**: 
  - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., Louvain, Leiden) to the normalized data.
  - Visualize the clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP).
- **Outcome**: Distinct cell clusters that represent different cell types or states.

### Clustering Quality Control
- **Objective**: Assess and ensure the quality of clustering results.
- **Actions**: 
  - Evaluate clustering metrics and visualization to validate clusters.
  - Refine clustering parameters
- **Outcome**: Reliable and interpretable clustering results.

### Marker Identification
- **Objective**: Identify marker genes for each cluster to characterize cell types.
- **Actions**: 
  - Use differential expression analysis to find marker genes for each cluster.
  - Annotate clusters based on the identified marker genes.
- **Outcome**: Detailed characterization of cell types within the dataset, providing insights into their biological functions.
